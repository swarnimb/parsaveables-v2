[HYZER]: Welcome folks!
[ANNIE]: Welcome folks!
[HYZER]: this is PAR SAVEABLES!
[ANNIE]: The world of heavy bags, curses, and pocket beers!
[HYZER]: I'm Hyzer, your resident stats nerd who gets too excited about stroke averages—
[ANNIE]: —and I'm Annie, here to make sure we actually tell you the good stories behind all those numbers. For those just tuning in, ParSaveables is our disc golf league where a bunch of degenerates compete in tournaments and full seasons, and let me tell you—
[HYZER]: —we track EVERYTHING! Points, birdies, aces, controversies, beer drama—
[ANNIE]: Oh, the beer drama. Speaking of which, we've got some absolute doozies to cover today. We're talking Minneapolis 2024, the entire 2025 season, and Portlandia 2025, which... wow.
[HYZER]: Controversies after controversies, Annie. And one that we literally cannot talk about.
[ANNIE]: The biggest the sport has ever seen, folks. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's start with Minneapolis, shall we?
[HYZER]: Absolutely! ... Five rounds, nine players, and Intern Line Cook took the whole thing with 19 points!
[ANNIE]: But here's the kicker—Bird won THREE of the five rounds and still finished second with 16 points!
[HYZER]: The format strikes again! Sometimes winning rounds doesn't mean winning tournaments, and that's just beautiful chaos to me.
[ANNIE]: Shogun rounded out the podium with 15 points, but honestly, the real story here isn't the leaderboard.
[HYZER]: It's what went down with the beer situation!
[ANNIE]: So there was this communal beer bag that was just sitting there, trusting that everyone would, you know, not be terrible people. Well...
[HYZER]: Beers started disappearing! Just vanishing into thin air! Or should I say, into certain people's pockets.
[ANNIE]: We're not naming names, but let's just say there were creative interpretations of the "beer bag." This led to the creation of the new pocket beer rule which is still being debated.
[HYZER]: And THEN—because apparently one beer controversy wasn't enough—we had the doubles round drama!
[ANNIE]: The doubles round! Technically doesn't count for points, but apparently counts for so much more.
[HYZER]: Things are getting way more complex than PDGA regulations.
[ANNIE]: But you know what? Through all that drama, Cobra threw an absolute bomb of an ace on day two. THE highlight of the whole tournament!
[HYZER]: Nothing settles all the controversies like chains rattling from 250 feet out with a sidearm blind downhill shot! Absolute carnage!!
[ANNIE]: Now let's talk about the big kahuna—the 2025 season!
[HYZER]: ... Oh, I've been waiting for this! Forty-one rounds, ten players, and Shogun absolutely dominated with 288 points!
[ANNIE]: Twelve wins! TWELVE! Shogun was just on another level this year.
[HYZER]: Jabba the Putt finished second with 273 points and Bird came in third with 244, followed by Fireball at 196, and Jaguar rounded out the top five with 160 points.
[ANNIE]: Now here's where it gets good. So Shogun wins the whole season, right? Dominates for months, puts up these incredible numbers—
[HYZER]: —and then complained about not getting a prize!
[ANNIE]: The audacity! But apparently, he DID get a prize...
[HYZER]: The highest bed in the Portlandia Airbnb! Some say that's prize enough!
[ANNIE]: Others said it's complete absurdity, but hey, prime real estate is prime real estate. Though I gotta say, the most tragic stat of 2025...
[HYZER]: Zero aces. ZERO! Not a single one all season long.
[ANNIE]: Don't forget Bird's ace at the Armadillo Mini! I know you don't count that as an ace, but an ACE is an ACE!!
[HYZER]: Sure, if you say so, Annie!
[ANNIE]: Which brings us to Portlandia 2025, and oh boy...
[HYZER]: ... Jabba the Putt took this one with 59 points over five rounds, with Intern Line Cook right behind at 55. Fireball grabbed third with 53.
[ANNIE]: And here again, the format strikes! Both Fireball and Jaguar had 2 wins apiece
[HYZER]: ... but yet again we saw that winning rounds doesn't mean winning tournaments
[ANNIE]: but honestly, the results are almost secondary to the absolute chaos that surrounded this tournament.
[HYZER]: Controversies after controversies, Annie. It was like watching a beautiful disc golf tournament slowly turn into a reality TV show.
[ANNIE]: We had shotgun trading controversies that could set terrible precedents for the future of the league—
[HYZER]: —which is saying something, considering our history with beer drama!
[ANNIE]: And then there's the trophy logistics crisis. I mean, do we even have a legitimate winner if they haven't received their trophy yet?
[HYZER]: And so many more philosophical questions that keep me up at night, Annie.
[ANNIE]: But all of that—ALL of it—pales in comparison to the big one. The controversy we literally cannot discuss on air.
[HYZER]: The biggest controversy the sport of disc golf has ever seen.
[ANNIE]: And it happened at our little tournament! We're not talking about PDGA drama or pro tour politics. This is homegrown, grade-A controversy.
[HYZER]: One that shall not be talked about, folks. At least not today.
[ANNIE]: The mystery remains...
[HYZER]: But hey, let's end on a positive note! 2026 is looking bright with some fresh blood joining the league.
[ANNIE]: That's right! We've got two new entrants: Food Zaddy and Scarlet Speedster!
[HYZER]: Food Zaddy! I love that name already. And Scarlet Speedster sounds like they're gonna bring some serious firepower on the fairways.
[ANNIE]: New players mean new rivalries, new dynamics, and hopefully some fresh perspectives on beer etiquette.
[HYZER]: And hopefully we get some answers, will that Portlandia trophy ever actually get delivered? And will the season winner actually get a prize this time that is more than an elevated bed?
[ANNIE]: Will the mysterious controversy ever be revealed? So many questions heading into the new season!
[HYZER]: I'm genuinely excited to see what the disc golf gods and the beloved Treesus have in store for these degenerates in 2026.
[ANNIE]: This wraps up 2024-2025 Spectacular Recap!
[HYZER]: But things are just getting started -
[ANNIE]: -let's see what the season opener has in store for us... 
[HYZER]: That too on the BEAST Metro! Literal chills...
[ANNIE]: Until then, keep those discs flying and your beers accounted for—
[HYZER]: —and we'll catch you next time on Par Saveables!
[ANNIE]: Where the bags are heavy, the language is colorful, and the controversies never end!
